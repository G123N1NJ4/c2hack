# Google Dorks

- **cache**: this dork will show you the cached version of any website, e.g. cache: securitytrails.com
- **allintext**: searches for specific text contained on any web page, e.g. allintext: hacking tools
- **allintitle**: exactly the same as allintext, but will show pages that contain titles with X characters, e.g. allintitle:"Security Companies"
- **allinurl**: it can be used to fetch results whose URL contains all the specified characters, e.g: allinurl client area
- **filetype**: used to search for any kind of file extensions, for example, if you want to search for jpg files you can use: filetype: jpg
- **inurl**: this is exactly the same as allinurl, but it is only useful for one single keyword, e.g.  inurl: admin
- **intitle**: used to search for various keywords inside the title, for example, intitle:security tools will search for titles beginning with “security” but “tools” can be somewhere else in the page.
- **inanchor**: this is useful when you need to search for an exact anchor text used on any links, e.g. inanchor:"cyber security"

- *****: wildcard used to search pages that contain “anything” before your word, e.g. how to * a website, will return “how to…” design/create/hack, etc… “a website”.
- **|**: this is a logical operator, e.g. "security" "tips" will show all the sites which contain “security” or “tips,” or both words.
- **+**: used to concatenate words, useful to detect pages that use more than one specific key, e.g. security + trails
- **–**: minus operator is used to avoiding showing results that contain certain words, e.g. security -trails will show pages that use “security” in their text, but not those that have the word “trails.”
